## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My project idea is for a web application to be built in Spring Boot called Insightful.  Insightful will be an online forum for employees of a company to post their ideas and insights in regards to their workplace.  This project idea is generic enough to be useful to any company.

Since employee insights in the workplace are sometimes overlooked, not acknowledged, or not transparent across the company, this application would increase transparency across the entire company, give employees a place to be heard, and offer management a tool to feel the pulse of the company.

### Features
  - Users can create and authenticate accounts.  However, their work email address must be in the database already in order to register.
  - Users can create, edit, and delete their own posts.
  - Users can comment on other user's posts.
  - Users can upvote or downvote original posts.  (Only one upvote per user per post.)
  - Users can sort posts either by the original post date or the number of upvotes.


### Technologies
  - Spring Boot
  - Java
  - Hibernate
  - SQL
  - MySQL
  - Thymeleaf templates

### What I'll Have to Learn
  - Sorting and Pagination.
  - Ensuring users can only delete and edit their own posts.
